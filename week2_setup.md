*The pushes and merge tests on Visual Studio as seen on fig.5 can also be seen  here on Fig.7 to have successfully been recieved on the Group Repository.


## Reflection


### *Configuring Visual Studio*


#### <ins>Set Up Process</ins>

Setting up the working environment and adding extensions aswell as using Git was a familiar process as I have used Visual studio in the past and often use Visual Studio Code paired with Github.

Although im Not too familiar with using .NET MAUI, Installing the MAUI Templates was also Straight forward as the assignment notes provided simple recommended instructions to do so and I also went through the official documentation on installation steps.

#### <ins>Moving Forward</ins>

As the team is in a fresh set up Stage the configurations at the moment are suitable but once we have a clearer sense of direction with the project as a team it will be best to update our configurations to suit perhaps by searching for suitable Visual Studio extensions and MAUI Workloads that could help productivity. One extension in mind (that the team could benifit from but doesnt require everyone to have) is Github Copilot which I have found very usefull in the past.

#### <ins>potential issues</ins>
As I am not too familiar with using .NET MAUI, more reaserch is planned to not hold back the team with lack of knowledge, this can be resolved by self learning and buddying with a member who has more familiarity with framework

#### <ins>potential issues as a team</ins>

At this stage I have two areas of concerns regarding potential issues that may occur moving forward:

 
 **1:** 
 
 At the moment all collaborators are able to push and merge changes into the main branch. During this stage it is not particularly harmfull to the project workflow but as the group is quite a large team, it will be safer to include branch protection rules in the repository settings especially for the main branch to ensure a safe and efficient workflow aswell as minimising setbacks and potential issues that may occur such as overwriting important work.

**2:**

As we have only decided on the same IDE Its also worth ensuring that each team member is using the same versions too where possible to minimise risk of errors and compatibility issues, this will also provide the added benifit of more experienced members of the team being better able to guide less experienced members when their working environments are the same or highly similar.
