# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

# System Specs

The computer system that is being used to for this project is the *ASUS ROG flow X13*.
The current specs of which are:

* Processor	AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS
* RAM	16.0 GB
* GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card

IDE: Visual Studio community 2022 (Current Version 17.7.3) 


This was chosen as it is both:
* Able to **efficiently run the expected softwares** for developing the project.
* A **Portable laptop** for attending meetings with the team and working from home.


# Working environments

The Project will be built using the **IDE: Visual Studio** and git version control to work from a shared repository among the team.








Each member of the team has been been given access to the repository to allow for group collaboration. At the moment all collaborators are able to push and merge changes into the main branch. During this stage it is not particularly harmfull to the project workflow but as the group is quite a large team, it will be safer to include branch protection rules in the repository settings especially for the main branch to ensure a safe and efficient workflow aswell as minimising setbacks and potential issues that may occur.

Its also worth ensuring that each team member is using the same IDE and version to minimise risk of errors and compatibility issues, this will also provide the added benifit of more experienced members of the team being better able to guide less experienced members when their working environments are the same or highly similar.

There are many usefull extensions to use on Visual Studio to assist in development which have yet to be decided on installed however Github Copilot is likley to be one of them.










## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
